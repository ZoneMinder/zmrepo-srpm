Zmrepo is an RPM repository for ZoneMinder rpm's and its dependencies.

The zmrepo github repository contains the source files necessary for building the zmrepo rpm.

Currently supported Linux distributions and architectures:
- el6 - CentOS/RHEL/SL 6 (x86, x86_64)
- el7 - CentOS/RHEL/SL 7 (x86_64 only)
- f26 - Fedora 23 (x86, x86_64, arm7hl)
- f27 - Fedora 23 (x86, x86_64, arm7hl)
 
NOTE: zmrepo maintains packages for the two most recent versions of CentOS and Fedora. Packages for older Redhat distros do exist. However, they are unmaintained and not guaranteed to remain indefinitely.

**Fedora and EL7 users should get the latest ZoneMinder releases from [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/).**
