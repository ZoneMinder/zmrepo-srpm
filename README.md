Zmrepo is a development RPM repository for ZoneMinder. 
This github repository contains the source files necessary for building the zmrepo rpm.

**CAUTION:** This repo is intended only for development and testing of our master branch. Do not use on production systems. Problems, crashes, etc are expected!

**Official stable releases of ZoneMinder are available from [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/).**

Zmrepo hosts packages for the two most recent versions of CentOS and Fedora. Packages for older Redhat distros do exist. However, they are unmaintained and not guaranteed to remain indefinitely.
